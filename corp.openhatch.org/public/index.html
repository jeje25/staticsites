<p>This site exists to provide more transparency for the OpenHatch organization.</p>

<p>Right now, there is a for-profit corporation that is closing down. As discussed at <a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2011/openhatch-gains-full-time-project-lead-transitioning-into-a-non-profit/">this blog post</a>, Asheesh Laroia is working on OpenHatch "full-time" and we are creating a non-profit.</p>

<p>For the moment, this site will contain a "Captain's Log": a blog of daily, quite-short updates by Asheesh on what happened in a day. They're quite informal.</p>

<p>Eventually I expect to publish OpenHatch's corporate documents here.</p>

<h2>Accounting</h2>

<p>We keep our accounting data in git. Access information:</p>

<p>First, get the git repo:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@vm3.openhatch.org:oh-accounting.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then, 'cd' in and get the ledger balance:</p>

<pre><code>cd oh-accounting
cd ledger-data
ledger -f 2012 bal --strict
</code></pre>

<p>Possible problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Don't have ledger installed?</em> apt-get install ledger, or install it from its own git repo</li>
<li><em>Don't have permission to do the git-clone?</em> Talk to Asheesh, and get him to add your SSH key.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Corporate paperwork, e.g. EIN Confirmation</h2>

<p>It's all in this git repo:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@vm3.openhatch.org:oh-corporate-documents.git
</code></pre>

<h2>California registration</h2>

<p>Here are the steps I'm going through (tracking them here):</p>

<p>Goal 1: Register as foreign corporation</p>

<ul>
<li>Get Certificate of Good Standing
<ul>
<li>Status: Received. (after a request from MA Secretary of State)</li>
<li>But the version I have needs to say that we're a nonstock, nonprofit corporation, and this doesn't.</li>
<li>So I just emailed a reply asking if they can add that.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Put $30 in the mail with the form.
<ul>
<li>I just requested that Bank of America send me a check proof, which I can then use to buy checks online from a check vendor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fill out the S^DC-NONPROFIT form, and send it in the mail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Goal 2: Perform our Business Filings with CA</p>

<ul>
<li>https://businessfilings.sos.ca.gov/</li>
</ul>

<p>Goal 3: File with Franchise Tax Board for nonprofit status</p>

<p>(If we don't do this, we pay $800 in yearly minimum California franchise tax.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Fill out FTB 3500, once we're registered. Deal with that post-registration.</li>
</ul>
