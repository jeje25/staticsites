<p>Captain's Log, initial</p>

<ul>
<li>Over the weekend, I read the entire How to form a non-profit book by Nolo Press. We're going to have to pay special attention to Schedule G. I think that our educational mission will fit nicely within 501(c)3.</li>
<li>Talked with Karen, who suggested I write more frequently about what I'm up to as the "project lead." Partly by emailing Peers more, and partly by keeping a daily "What I've done related to OpenHatch" diary. I decided to call that the Captain's Log.</li>
<li>Asked one prospective board member if she'd consider a board seat. She said she'd consider it.</li>
<li>I'm happy about the way the front page redesign is going and quite happy with the progress toward having a Boston Python Workshop website. Jessica McKellar is working on fundraising for BPW.</li>
</ul>
