<p>Captain's log, Mon through Tue, March 26-27, 2012</p>

<p>Monday March 26:</p>

<ul>
<li>Was interviewed by Christina Dunbar-Hester, Assistant Professor of Journalism &amp; Media Studies at Rutgers, about feminism and free software.</li>
<li>Asked greg-g to write a PyCon sprints follow-up blog post (:</li>
<li>Began scheduling a time with Deb to visit BoA and give her access to the bank acct</li>
<li>Reviewed last week's goals, and concluded there is a lot more work to do on those</li>
<li>Created a virtual machine on xvm.mit.edu to test OpenHatch backups</li>
</ul>

<p>Tuesday March 27:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pinged Karen about T-shirt next steps</li>
<li>Automated 3/4 of the process required for automatic testing of backups, and communicated about this to OH-Dev.</li>
<li>Configured our nightly backup job to remove broken backups which are cluttering our space there</li>
<li>Configured our nightly backup job to remove all but 2 weeks of backups (so we stop filling up our quota)</li>
<li>Fixed oh-bugimporters and moved stale bug count from 100% to 37%</li>
<li>Filed bugs as appropriate about the bug importers</li>
<li>Discussed on OH-Dev what needs to be done for the missions documentation to get written</li>
<li>Spent morning chatting with Michael Stone about his recent email to Peers about learning styles. Particular touchpoints for OpenHatch:
<ul>
<li>When people sign up, we could tell them we want to know about their learning style.</li>
<li>The front page could use testimonials.</li>
<li>We/I could write a blog post about how the amazingly-successful BPW is just the latest in a long slew of mostly-unsuccessful Python teaching attempts from me. This one is successful, though, and that's because I kept trying.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Replied to some Tweets that were relevant to us.</li>
</ul>
