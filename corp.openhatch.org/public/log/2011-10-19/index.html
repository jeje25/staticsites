<p>Captain's log, supplemental</p>

<ul>
<li>Answered two people who had questions about why bug import wasn't working</li>
<li>Deleted some accounts based on people having emailed hello@openhatch requesting it</li>
<li>Talked with Devin Balkind <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Devin_Balkind">http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Devin_Balkind</a> who is part of Occupy Wall Street and wants to help me connect people excited about contributing to open source with projects. Talking with him was mega fun.</li>
<li>Ran into Jason Alonso, whose experience with http://learningu.org/ might be interesting for OpenHatch.</li>
<li>Thought about my need for health insurance. I expect to look into Massachusetts' offerings shortly.</li>
<li>Failed to finish following up with a potential sponsor and Julie Deroche because of abruptly discovering poor time planning and having to rush to a Boston Python user group organizers' meeting.</li>
<li>Sent a version of Jessica's Boston Python Workshop grant proposal to the outreach + education committee within Python Software Foundation. Spent some time fine-tuning an introduction that explains the grant and how it has progressed so far.</li>
<li>Made a whole slew of "final" changes to a Boston Python Workshop site. Happy to ship it pending answers to my questions that I asked on Events@.</li>
<li>Worked again at Alex Ose's office. Was good, but maybe slightly distracting to have the coworkers there. Probably about the same as a coffee shop, though; more distracting but more comfy than Media Lab.</li>
</ul>
