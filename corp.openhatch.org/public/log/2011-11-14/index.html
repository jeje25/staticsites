<p>Captain's Log, November 14, 2011</p>

<ul>
<li>Published 0.11.07 release notes, backdated to the past</li>
<li>On the blog, I hit "publish" on Karen's jack-o-lantern post (which sadly "missed its schedule" within WordPress)</li>
<li>Dramatically cleaned up the "Getting started with the OpenHatch code" wiki page</li>
<li>I (and Jessica) spent some time discussing misconceptions about OpenHatch with Jennifer Redman (jenred), who was at the Grace Hopper convention</li>
<li>Emailed lawyer Jonas with a ping re: non-profit paperwork; he gave me a pong and said he'd be in touch soon.</li>
<li>Added the Dreamwidth Bugzilla bug tracker to the new system, and cleaned up some spam on the old bug tracker requests, and made sure its bugs got imported</li>
<li>Spent <em>hours</em> talking with glyph (of Twisted) about how we can use Twisted better within OpenHatch; this was an extremely positive conversation</li>
<li>Published a short blog post with 0.11.10 release notes</li>
<li>Discussed with Karen Rustad if we might move the repository to Github, and it is looking increasingly likely. She pushed a copy of the repo there. We agreed it'd be nice to keep Gitorious in sync.</li>
<li>Talked with Dharmishta Rood about static website generation, and learned about a convenient jQuery image slider plugin that might be good to use in the Boston Python Workshop site</li>
<li>Spent some time helping a Boston Python person get a dev environment for Python (the interpreter) set up so she could hack on a python.org ticket</li>
</ul>

<p>It was a reasonably productive day, but I'm getting behind on the P2PU course, crucially.</p>
