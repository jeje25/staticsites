<p>Captain's log, stardate 1111.04</p>

<p>Organization:</p>

<ul>
<li>Talked with Deborah Nicholson about a job description for board members, how to invite them, and about different possible board members.</li>
<li>Received an email from a prospective anonymous donor for campus-based outreach events that I was taking too long to get back in touch with him and that he put his money elsewhere (which naturally I'm sad about).</li>
<li>Gave some feedback to Karen about an outreach-related talk for Wikimedia, where she'll mention OpenHatch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added more tests to cover the bug import code, and added the KDE bug tracker to the live site's Bugzilla list.</li>
<li>Things are looking really good for the async bug import code, although the customs_twist process seemed to be stuck in a CPU-heavy loop without making any progress toward the end of its run. (Reasonable next step: Run it in a profiler next time.)</li>
<li>Began to diagnose problem with Plasma Active within the new bug import regime.</li>
</ul>
