<p>Captains log, supplemental</p>

<ul>
<li>I located the meeting notes from Jessica McKellar's and my conversation with Julie at Mozilla. I wrote them up in an e-mail I sent to the events mailing list.</li>
<li>I located and found the meeting minutes from the past to IRC weekly meeting and put them online. I e-mailed them to OH-Dev.</li>
<li>I pushed the funding  proposal along that Jessica started on the Python software foundation Board mailing list. I read the information about the structure of the outreach and education committee, and set some deadlines for discussion and voting.</li>
<li>Also, today was my birthday. My hands hurt a little bit, and I made it a little bit of a short day.</li>
