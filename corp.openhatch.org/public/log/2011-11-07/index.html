<p>Captain's log, supplemental</p>

<p>Over the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>I spent a lot of time on writing and choosing bylaws and articles of incorporation.</li>
<li>I spent a lot of time discussing non-profit boards with Mike Linksvayer. It was a great conversation.</li>
<li>I aim to deliver all this to our lawyer Tuesday and then we can iterate with him.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Woke up later than I wanted to.</li>
<li>Reviewed a patch by viv in the tracker.</li>
<li>Reviewed (at length) Jessica McKellar's suggested changes for bostonpythonworkshop.com and planned blog post for pyfound. Adjusted image sizes, and shipped her BPW website changes.</li>
<li>Added a note of deprecation to the old bugtracker import code, and removed most references to it.</li>
<li>Spent some time writing up notes for how people can help, before the Project Night. This should come in handy for later wannabe-contributor roundups.</li>
<li>At Python Project Night, I worked a few people through getting OH dev setups ready. It was, basically, a tragic flop. But I learned that 1) it sucks still, and 2) it can be fixed (if we use more pure-Python dependencies, and gracefully give error messages when things won't work (rather than make sure that buildout makes sure everything will work).</li>
</ul>
