<p>Captain's log, December 20, 2011</p>

<p>(Note: I'm in San Francisco until Thursday, then on-and-off next week.)</p>

<p>(The following took place Monday, Dec 19:)</p>

<ul>
<li>Spent 2 hours in the Wikimedia Foundation office talking excitedly with two of their tech staff about possible collaborations.
** I took notes and will send a note to OH-Board with more details.</li>
<li>Planned meetings with other people in SF who might be helpful or interesting to talk with.</li>
<li>Fixed an out-of-disk-space condition (cause: Roundup's log was 2.3 gigabytes). </li>
</ul>

<p>(The following took place Tue, Dec 20:)</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussed site reliability with Karen Rustad</li>
<li>Spent a few hours adjusting /search/ to be speedier. Particularly, now it does not generate suggested searches. This can be re-enabled with a settings.py option. It is still not quite fast enough.</li>
<li>Discussed the history of OpenHatch with an old friend, Ben Lowenstein, who is now working on a web-based language learning project.</li>
<li>Discussed fundraising with Allison formerly of CC's fundraising team.</li>
</ul>
