<p>Captain's log, February 1, 2012</p>

<p>There haven't been captain's logs for the past few days.</p>

<p>Tue, Feb 1, 2012:</p>

<ul>
<li>Planned (and requested) PyCon hotel stay period, finally.</li>
<li>Spent <em>ages</em> fixing the performance of the project page and related things to something reasonable so I can deploy an I-want-to-help handling UI. Arguably done with the performance changes.</li>
<li>Tomorrow I can sanity-check the I-want-to-help-handler UI and then push it.</li>
<li>Spent a couple of hours catching up with Sameer Verma at SFSU (San Francisco State University). He is enthusiastic about bringing something like OpenHatch Comes to Campus to SFSU.</li>
<li>In that process, did a lunch talk and found some bugs on the site; but generally attendees really appreciated the site and our events.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tue, Jan 31, 2012:</p>

<ul>
<li>Was interviewed by a researcher in New Zealand about newcomers' experiences in FLOSS, and my experiences with OpenHatch and other projects.</li>
<li>Sent information about our (sadly rejected) RISE grant application to a friend at Google Policy to see if he has any suggestions.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Subversion training mission where submitting an empty form would cause an HTTP error</li>
<li>Looked into options to pass to duplicity to figure out what is taking up space in our backup jobs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mon, Jan 30, 2012:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scheduled a lunch with Matt Zimmerman, after much trying</li>
<li>Scheduled an evening meeting a friend of a friend who might have advice on fundraising</li>
<li>Went to a book mixer in the hopes of finding kindred OpenHatchy spirits. I did find Geoff Schmidt, at least.</li>
<li>Adjusted the configuration of logrotate so that our incremental backups take up less space.</li>
</ul>
