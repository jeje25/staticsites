<p>Captain's log, supplemental</p>

<p>This log covers the first week of November, up to
and including Thursday, November 3.</p>

<p>I was traveling and didn't get as much work done as I expected.
Some things that did happen.</p>

<p>Weekend, plus Monday, October 31:</p>

<ul>
<li>Made lots of changes to the bug import code to support custom bug parser code.</li>
<li>Pushed this and got some feedback from Jack Grigg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tuesday, November 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussed PyStar+BPW collaboration with Jessica McKellar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wednesday, November 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>Met with Jackie of PyLadies DC and got a sense of what the group is like. They are planning to run a BPW-esque event in mid-January at the earliest. I learned a lot about libraries from Jackie, and she was patient with me as I nailed down the rest of my travel schedule. I talked at length about BPW and what makes it successful. She wondered what would happen if companies request smaller, private BPW-esque workshops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thursday, November 3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Made lots of changes to the bug import code to make it more testable.</li>
<li>Officially delayed the 0.11.10 release until Sun Nov 6.</li>
</ul>
