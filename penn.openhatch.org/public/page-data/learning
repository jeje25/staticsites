<h2>Why do it?</h2>

<p>Open source software like Linux and Firefox are used by hundreds of millions of people.
This event is the fast track to participating.</p>

<p>If you come out on Saturday, we'll teach you how the community works. You'll get to play with
essential tools like version control and IRC chat.</p>

<h2>You want me to go to class on Saturday?</h2>

<p>It's not really <em>class</em>. For half an hour, five students and one teacher will discuss
a particular topic, like how projects collaborate using bug trackers. Then you get to
<strong>try things out</strong> on your own computer. Then onto the next topic.</p>

<p>Plus you will get lunch and other goodies like books and subscriptions.</p>

<h2>Can anyone sign up?</h2>

<p>You have to be a student at a Philadelphia-area college or university to attend. (If you want to run a similar event
at a different college, email us at <strong>penn@openhatch.org</strong>.)</p>

<p>On Saturday, we only have room for 20 people. We're looking for people who like technical crafts that
scale well across the Internet. That usually means software programming, user interface design,
technical writing, and testing. And we're looking for people who are enthusiastic!</p>

<h2>So sign up</h2>

<b>Sorry we are full for Saturday and canot accept any more applications. Everyone is welcome to come to the Sunday hackathon.</b>

<p><b>Remember: you only have to sign up for the Saturday workshop!</b> You can just show up on Sunday for the hackathon, although a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=109664059095389">Facebook RSVP</a> would be cool too.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
Attendees will meet up at the entrance to Penn engineering at 34th and Walnut on Saturday, September 25th. (We have to let you in, doors are locked on the weekend). If you have any trouble getting there give Yuvi Masory a call at 267-979-9156.
The session will start at 11am sharp and run until 5:30pm. You will go to a local restaurant with your group (about 5 students) in the middle. For free.
