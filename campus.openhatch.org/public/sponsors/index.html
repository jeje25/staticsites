<h2>Become a sponsor</h2>

<p>Do you represent a big free software project with contributors
around the globe? We would love to partner with you on getting those
people into classrooms and teaching university students.</p>

<p>Do you represent a company that uses open source heavily?
We want your help financing travel and other event expenses.
By sponsoring Open Source Comes to Campus, we will give your
brand more visibility and showcase your company's open source
connections to students who will soon be entering the workforce.
With your support, we can teach open source participation and
collaboration skills to hundreds or thousands of students.</p>

<p>Our goal is to bring local open source
community members to campuses world-wide, bridging the two
communities and making both stronger. By focusing on building
local community, we keep costs low while also increasing the
chance of sustained involvement on both sides.</p>

<h2>How to become a sponsor</h2>

<p>If you are interested in sponsoring, by donating
funds or providing in-kind donations,
let us know at <a href="mailto:hello@openhatch.org">hello@openhatch.org</a>.
If you are part of an open source project and want to help
teach these events, send us email as well!</p>

<p>We are seeking volunteers to join us in the classroom, as well asongoing
sponsors willing to fund curriculum development. You can support
open source in your community, now and in the years to come, by donating.</p>

<p>Open Source Comes to Campus is a project of OpenHatch, a
Massachusetts not-for-profit corporation. Read more on
