                                        <p>Students like you around the world are gaining
                                        valuable experience, connections, and skills by
                                        coding, testing, and writing for free software
                                        projects like Firefox, WordPress, Wikipedia's backend
                                        code, and SAGE.</p>

                                        <p>You do <em>not</em> need to know how to program to
                                        contribute to free software. You can contribute code,
                                        but also original art, testing, documentation, web
                                        design, or anything else. We want to teach you how to
                                        join them.</p>

                        <h2>More about open source</h2>
                        <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                        shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                        great way to apply your skills to real-world projects
                        and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                        reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                        translating the interface to another language, making
                        video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                        ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                        of people collaborating across time and space, and
                        this event specially welcomes newcomers to that style
                        of development.</p>

                        <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                        real-world skills and make connections that will last
                        you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                        professionals and academics who use open source
                        daily.</p>
