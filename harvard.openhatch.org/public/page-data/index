<h2>Open source comes to campus</h2>

<p>We're free software enthusiasts.</p>

<p>We want college students to have the community knowledge and technical skills to participate in
globally distributed software projects: Big ones, like
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> and 
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, and small ones, like
<a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/">PyBlosxom</a> and
<a href="http://rephial.org/">angband</a>.</p>

<p>Does that sound cool? We'll teach you.</p>
<p>You do <b>not</b> need to know how to program to contribute to free software. You can contribute code, but also original art, testing, documentation, web design, or anything else.</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>On <strong>Saturday, February 16th</strong>, we invite you to a day-long immersion event.</p>
<p>In the morning, we'll teach you about open source licensing, collaboration tools, and how free software projects
are organized.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we'll help you make contributions to open source projects.</p>
<p>And throughout the day, we'll feed you, get to know you, and talk with you about opportunities for students in open source.</p>
<p>Space is pretty limited, so we'll focus on people with a real interest in learning. You must apply for a spot by filling out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG9HM05FRXpzdS1PS1gzYWZQYW5SN3c6MQ">this form</a>. Don't delay!</p>
