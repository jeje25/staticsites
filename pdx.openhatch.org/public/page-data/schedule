<h2>Why do it?</h2>

<p>Open source software like Linux and Firefox are used by hundreds of millions of people.
This event is the fast track to participating.</p>

<p>If you come out on Saturday, we'll teach you how the community works. You'll get to play with
essential tools like version control and IRC chat.</p>

<h2>What are we doing?</h2>

<p>In the morning, after coffee and breakfast, we'll have three introductory tutorials:</p>
<ul><li>Introduction to Open Source Communication Tools</li>
<li>Introduction to the Command Line</li>
<li>Introduction to Version Control Using Git</li></ul>
<p>Then we'll have a career panel, where people who work on open source projects for a living will tell you about their experiences and answer your questions.</p>
<p>We'll share lunch, and then afterwards you'll work with mentors to pick an open source project, find a bug to fix, and make a contribution.</p>
<p>Coffee will be out at 9am, tutorials start at 10am, and the workshop will go until 5pm.</p>
