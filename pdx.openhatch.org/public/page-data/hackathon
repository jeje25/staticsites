<h2>An open source hackathon</h2>

<p>Bring your laptop and work on an open source software project.
You can program, write documentation,
make fun of people through <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>,
discover and report usability problems, and more.</p>

<p>The point of this hackathon is to help you get your hands dirty working on a real project. To help with that,
we'll have Asheesh Laroia from <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>
and other community members in attendance. If you don't know what you want to work on,
or you get stuck, you can ask for help, ideas, or advice.</p>

<p>This is a perfect opportunity to work on your problem-solving 
skills, and learn to collaborate with other open source programmers.</p>
